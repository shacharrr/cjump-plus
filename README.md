## How To Use

1. Download the executable from the releases or compile from source code
2. Place the executable in whatever folder you want (Don't forget that a config folder will be created in this folder)
3. Run executable and have fun (A config will be automatically created on first run)

## Is it safe
Couldn't tell if its totally safe, but it is at least as safe as the previous [cjump](https://github.com/zasbu/crouchjump) and [tunrbinds](https://github.com/t5mat/turnbinds/).
 For some reason this program is flagged as a virus for some people (It's not a virus) :)
